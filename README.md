# Bristol Balloon Fiesta 2018

## Overview

This site is my Front End Project for the **Code Institute**'s Full Stack Web Development course, which I amm commpleting using online resources.

This is a dummy site for Bristol Balloon Fiesta 2018. It is devised as a tool to aid those wishing to find out about the Fiesta, provide them with a list of events taking place during the course of the weekend, and provide a means to apply online to book a balloon flight (with necessary validation uopn submission of the form).


## Features

I wanted this project to have the look of a professional website: although I have used **bootstrap** I wanted to override it significantly to achieve a much more custom-designed feel.

The use of a carousel, collapsing panels, the video link, and form validation/submission are created to expressly utilise features which I desired to practice implementing. They do not all form part of the brief for this project but are used to help achieve the aforementioned professional and custom-built feel.

Currently there are some features which require fine-tuning:
- The collapsing nav on mobile should minimise once any link is tapped
- I intend to make the carousel view as full-page in all screen sizes and orientations higher than 992px
- The collapsing panels on the 'What's On' page jump to the bottom of the panel whereas for good UX it should stay at the top

Earlier incarnations of this project included a more complex footer panel, a drop-down sub-menu on the navbar and links to many other dummy (but ostensibly empty) pages, all to enhance the overall look and feel of this project. At the advice of my mentor at Code Institute I have removed these features for now as they don't show any 'new' functionality. I hope to reinstate these features at some point in the future.


## Tech Used
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
    - I have used **AngularJS** to handle page routing, and build custom directives, in particular to enable form validation and submission
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
	- I have used jquery to manipulate the DOM specifically in dealing with the submit button and the modal pop-up.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    - I have used **Bootstrap** to give this project a simple, responsive layout
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
    - **npm** is used to help manage some of the dependencies in this project
- [bower](https://bower.io/)
    - **Bower** is used to manage the installation of libraries and frameworks

## Acknowledgements
This is all my own work but I wish to gratefully acknowledge the support and advice of my mentors and tutors at Code Institute, as well as the contribution of my cohort of student colleagues via **slack**'s cloud-based communication channels.
